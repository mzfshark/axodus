# Design QA

**Source visual truth path:** `design/UI-Pack/` (`02-foundations/tokens.css`, `03-components/components.css`, `04-examples/examples.html`, and supplied SVG assets)

**Implementation screenshot path:** unavailable

**Viewport:** not captured

**Dimensions and density:** unavailable; no browser-rendered implementation capture was authorized or produced.

**State:** homepage and `/platforms/`, default desktop and responsive states pending browser review.

## Findings

- Browser-rendered comparison is blocked. The implementation uses the supplied UI-Pack tokens, components, spacing rules, and SVG assets, but code and build output are not visual evidence.
- Responsive layout, focus presentation, asset crop, typography rendering, and final spacing cannot be accepted without captures at matching desktop and mobile viewports.

## Comparison Evidence

- Full-view comparison: not performed; implementation screenshot is missing.
- Focused region comparison: not performed for the same blocker.
- Comparison history: no visual iteration was possible.

## Technical Evidence

- Next.js/Vercel production build: passed.
- Vinext static build and artifact validation: passed.
- ESLint: passed without warnings.
- Rendered HTML tests: passed, including canonical metadata, JSON-LD, platform links, unlinked conceptual domains, sitemap configuration, and robots configuration.

## Implementation Checklist

1. Start the local preview in the user-selected browser.
2. Capture homepage and `/platforms/` at desktop and mobile viewports.
3. Compare captures with the UI-Pack example at matching dimensions.
4. Check navigation, external CTAs, keyboard focus, console errors, overflow, and asset rendering.
5. Record fixes and repeat the same-viewport comparison before human approval.

**final result: blocked**

Blocker: no user-selected browser or browser-rendered comparison evidence is available.
